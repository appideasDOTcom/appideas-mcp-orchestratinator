# Working in this repo

Orientation for an agent that has not been here before. The README explains what
the orchestratinator is and how to install it; this file is the handful of things
that are easy to get wrong and expensive to re-learn.

## The one rule everything else follows from

**A conversation is one `claude` process, so one app holds it at a time.** Not a
document two windows can share. The floor shows who holds a desk, and moving it
is an explicit handoff: your editor's tab closes, the host opens a tmux window
with `claude --resume <session>`, and "Open in VS Code" reverses it. Anything
proposing to have both live at once is re-litigating a question that has already
been answered the hard way.

State lives in three places, and they must agree:

| What | Where | Read it with |
|---|---|---|
| Which processes are alive | Claude Code's roster | `claude agents --json` |
| Which pane runs which pid | tmux | `tmux list-panes -a -F …` |
| Who the board thinks holds it | the server | `curl -s localhost:8787/api/floor` |

`holderOf()` in [`host/window.js`](host/window.js) is the join of the first two:
a session in the roster with no pane means an editor has it.

## Three boards, one of them ours

Desks on this machine point at three different servers. **Only
`http://localhost:8787` is in scope.** `http://10.0.42.120:8787` is Chris's own
server and `https://appideas-mcp.ngrok.dev` is a tunnel — do not test against,
register with, or read from either. Most discovered desks point at 10.0.42.120,
so `[host] skipping <desk> — its board is http://10.0.42.120…` is correct
behaviour, not a fault. The host pins its board with `url` in
`~/.orchestratinator/host.json`; when desks disagree and nothing pins it, the
host refuses to start rather than guess.

## The host

A launchd job (`com.appideas.orchestratinator-host`), not part of the Docker
stack. It reaches out only — the server never connects to a workstation.

```
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.appideas.orchestratinator-host   # restart
tail -f ~/.orchestratinator/log/host.log                                 # watch
```

It logs almost nothing after startup, so absence of log is not absence of
activity. **After editing `host/*.js` you must restart it** — nothing reloads,
and a running process older than the file is the most common reason a fix
"didn't work". Compare `ps -o lstart=` against the file's mtime rather than
assuming.

Two loops run side by side in [`host/index.js`](host/index.js): `watchLoop()`
relays the conversation, `run()` handles work. Keep them apart. When they shared
one loop, delivering a message blocked the relay for up to a minute — the floor
went silent mid-conversation and then dumped the backlog in one batch.

## Tests

`npm test` runs six suites. `test:host` and `test:window` are not unit tests:
they drive **real tmux panes** against a **real server**, with a stand-in
`claude` (a `.cjs`, because this package is `"type": "module"`). They use their
own tmux session names and ports, so they are safe to run beside a live host —
but a suite killed halfway leaves a server on port 8896 and fixtures in `data/`,
which will poison the next run. Check for both before concluding a failure is
real.

## Conventions

- **Git is Chris's.** Never commit, push, or offer to. Leave changes in the
  working tree; reviewing the diff is how he checks the work.
- **Errors state what is observed, never a guessed cause.** A message that named
  one likely reason for a stalled window sent two people after a dialog that was
  not on screen while the real prompt sat there unread. Quote the pane.
- Comments here explain *why*, especially where the obvious approach was tried
  and failed. Several say so outright. Preserve that when editing near them.
