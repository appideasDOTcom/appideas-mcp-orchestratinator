Things worth doing that nobody is doing yet. One entry per item; say what was
seen, not what was guessed, and note where it came from so the next person can

## Better instructions for switching away from localhost / changing MCP servers

The README's only mention is one sentence in step 5 (install the host): if
desks point at more than one board, pin one with `./host/install.sh --url …`.
The example is localhost and it reads as an install-time tie-breaker.

What is missing:

- That the host serves exactly one board, and the board can be another
  machine on the network. The whole "production board on the LAN, development
  board on localhost" shape is undocumented.
- How to move a host to a different board: edit `url` in
  `~/.orchestratinator/host.json` (or re-run `install.sh --url`), then restart
  the LaunchAgent, then read the host log to see which desks it now serves and
  which it skips.
- What the floor says when the host is pinned elsewhere — "No host on this
  board is running that repo" — with no pointer to the host pin as the first
  thing to check.
- Where the MCP server address lives for each repo (`url` in its `.mcp.json`)
  versus where the host's board lives (`host.json`), and that both must name
  the same server for "Open on the floor" to appear.

Seen 2026-09-02, first live use of the floor against the production server:
this repo's `.mcp.json` pointed at the network board while the host stayed
pinned to localhost, and the floor reported no host.
